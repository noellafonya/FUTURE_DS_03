# ðŸŽ“ College Event Feedback Analysis  

This project is part of my *Data Science & Analytics Internship* (Task-3).  
The goal was to analyze student survey feedback from college events (workshops, tech fests, cultural activities) to uncover *satisfaction trends* and *suggest improvements* for future events.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
College events collect feedback through surveys, but often this data isnâ€™t fully used.  
In this project, I:  
- Cleaned and prepared survey data from Google Forms (CSV export).  
- Analyzed ratings (1â€“5 scale) to uncover patterns in satisfaction.    
- Created visualizations with *seaborn/matplotlib* to present insights.  
- Suggested actionable improvements for future events.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- *Google Colab* â€“ notebook environment  
- *pandas* â€“ data manipulation  
- *matplotlib / seaborn* â€“ visualizations

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository  
- Feedback Analysis.ipynb â†’ Colab notebook with full code and explanations  
- Student_Satisfaction_Survey.csv â†’ dataset used  
- rating_distribution.png â†’ overall distribution of ratings  
- top10_questions.png â†’ top questions with highest satisfaction  
- course_satisfaction.png â†’ course-wise satisfaction comparison  

---

## ðŸ“¥ How to Use  
1. Clone this repo or download the files.  
2. Open feedback_analysis.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights  
- Students were generally satisfied with event organization, but areas like *mentoring, ICT integration, and personalized feedback* need improvement.  
- Certain courses showed consistently higher ratings compared to others.    

---

## ðŸš€ Suggestions for Future Events  
- Provide more *mentoring and guidance* during workshops.  
- Encourage teachers to use *modern ICT tools* (interactive slides, online resources).  
- Increase *feedback and follow-up* mechanisms for students.  
- Promote events across all departments to ensure equal participation.
